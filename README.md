# New exporter success prediction tool

## 1. Problem Description

By engaging in exports, firms gain access to a wider consumer base which can potentially lead them to expand their production, reducing costs through economies of scale and generating new jobs. Also, international trade often attract foreign investment and technological progress, which further contribute to economic growth. Therefore, the success and growth of new exporters is of importance not only for the profitability of firms but also for economic development. Unfortunately, the survival of exporters in new markets is significantly low, related studies indicate that more than 50% of new exporters do not continue exporting after the first year. 

Can firms be strategic when selecting new export markets to maximize their potential of success? The objective of this project is to develop a ML model to predict whether an exporter entering a new market will be successful based on their previous experience, as well as the products traded and the new market selected. The measure of success employed will be that the exporter continues to actively export to the new market in the year following the decision of market entry.
