**ML Zoomcamp - Capstone Project 2**
# New exporter success prediction tool

## 1. Problem Description

By engaging in exports, firms gain access to a wider consumer base which can potentially lead them to expand their production, reducing costs through economies of scale and generating new jobs. Also, international trade often attract foreign investment and technological progress, which further contribute to economic growth. Therefore, the success and growth of new exporters is of importance not only for the profitability of firms but also for economic development. Unfortunately, the survival of exporters in new markets is significantly low, related studies indicate that more than 50% of new exporters do not continue exporting after the first year. 

Can firms be strategic when selecting new export markets to maximize their potential of success? The objective of this project is to develop a ML model to predict whether an exporter entering a new market will be successful based on their previous experience, as well as the products traded and the new market selected. The measure of success employed will be that the exporter continues to actively export to the new market in the year following the decision of market entry.

## 2. Dataset

The dataset selected for this project contains all record of new export transactions registered in Colombia between 2017 and 2021. This dataset was obtained by aggregrating all export transactions filed to the Colombia Tax Authority - DIAN between 2016 and 2022. The aggregate records were then explored to identify new exporters in a new market, which for the purpose of this project are defined as exports to a market by an exporter that in the previous year was not active in such country. Finally, additional features about the new market as well as prior export experience from the previous year (if available) were added to the records of new exporters in a new market. All steps to obtain the dataset from original export records (available for download at https://microdatos.dane.gov.co/index.php/catalog/472/get-microdata) are included in the GenerateDataset.ipynb notebook.
